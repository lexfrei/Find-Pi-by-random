Find-Pi-by-random - Find Pi by random shots


# SYNOPSIS

main [options]


# DESCRIPTION

The number π is a mathematical constant, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, commonly approximated as 3.14159.

This program makes the "shots" in the square and finds hits in relation to all the inscribed circle "shots".

This program was test from interview to Прогрэдис, Russian IT company. One my friend sends this to me: You have foursquare and inscribed circle, you have to do random shots to the foursquare and find Pi.


# OPTIONS

   -r=*INT*

Set circle size

   -shots=_INT_

Set shots count

# SAMPLE OUTPUT
    Radius   = 10000000
    Shots    = 10000000
    Pi       = 3.141492
    Accuracy = 0.999968
    Time     = 779.1206ms
